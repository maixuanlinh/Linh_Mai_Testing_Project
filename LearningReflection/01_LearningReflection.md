# Learning Reflection Report

> Here are my reflections based on the suggested questions.

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- Testing the web application was a challenging yet insightful experience. It provided me with a practical understanding of how testing integrates into the development cycle and how crucial it is for delivering a reliable product. Identifying bugs like the typographical error really highlighted the attention to detail required in this profession.

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- I managed my test cases by first outlining the critical functionalities that needed verification based on the user requirements. I then created detailed test cases in Markdown format, ensuring each step was clear and reproducible. This process involved a lot of iteration and refinement, especially when aligning the test cases with the actual functionalities of the web app.

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management.
- For managing test cases more efficiently, especially in a collaborative setting, I recommend using tools like TestRail or Zephyr. These tools offer excellent integration with issue-tracking systems like JIRA, enhancing traceability and visibility across the testing lifecycle.

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- I used Visual Studio Code for editing files. Its user-friendly interface, extensive plugin support, and Git integration made managing and updating test scripts very efficient.

## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- I encountered issues with setting up consistent environments for testing which initially led to inconsistent bug reproductions. I resolved this by using Docker containers to standardize the testing environment across different machines, which helped in maintaining consistency.

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- I did not encounter significant troubles using GitHub, as I had previous experience using it for version control during other academic projects. The familiarity helped in efficiently managing branches and commits for this testing project.

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- If I were to automate these test cases in the future, I would choose Selenium due to its versatility and support for multiple browsers and platforms. Its wide community support and plethora of resources would be invaluable in quickly setting up automated tests.

## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- From my research, the most in-demand skills for testers currently include automation with tools like Selenium and QTP, proficiency in scripting languages such as Python and JavaScript, and a strong understanding of CI/CD pipelines. Competencies in agile methodologies and DevOps practices are also highly valued.

## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- To advance in a software testing career, I need to enhance my skills in automation frameworks like Cypress and Robot Framework. Additionally, improving soft skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and effective communication is essential to collaborate better with development teams.

## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module).
- This project was instrumental in bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. It allowed me to apply what I've learned about testing methodologies directly to real-world scenarios, enhancing my understanding and skills in software testing. One suggestion would be to include more interactive sessions or workshops on advanced testing tools and techniques to further enrich the learning experience.
