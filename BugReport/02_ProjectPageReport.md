## Summary
Typographical Error in Project Creation Interface

## Steps to reproduce
1. Open a web browser and navigate to the GitLab project creation page at [https://gitlab.com/projects/new](https://gitlab.com/projects/new).
2. On the project creation page, observe the various project creation options displayed.
3. Locate the option to create a new project which incorrectly displays the text "Create black project."

## What is the current bug behavior?
The option to create a new project incorrectly displays the text "Create black project" instead of "Create blank project."

## What is the expected correct behavior?
The option should accurately display "Create blank project," correctly describing the action of creating a new blank project.

## Relevant logs and/or screenshots
- Screenshot of the incorrect option text:

## Possible fixes
This bug can be resolved by correcting the typo in the source code where the option text is defined. The string "Create black project" should be corrected to "Create blank project."

- **Assign To**: Project Manager or UI Developer responsible for interface text and localization.
- **Tags**: `bug`, `ui`, `typo`, `needs-review`

## Priority
Minor - This issue does not affect the functionality of creating projects but should be corrected to maintain professionalism and prevent user confusion.
